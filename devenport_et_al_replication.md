# Notes on Replication of Devenport et al. (1997)

## Procedure

### Pretraining
- Devenport et al. familiarized the rats with the training platform, being returned to their home cage, etc. However, they did not provide any training to the rats on the actual patches used in the experimental task.

- AOs will thus not undergo any pretraining because familiarization with the task is not necessary.

### Formal Training
- Devenport et al. placed a divider that confined the rats to one side of the platform for a specific patch (A or B). The rats were all run at a rate of 1 successful foraging trip every 150s using an ITI. The rats were allowed up to 50s to complete their foraging trip.
- The rats completed 16 trials, 8 visits to patch A while it had reinforcement available and 8 visits to patch B while it did not have reinforcement available.
- The rats then completed 16 more trials, 8 visits to patch A while it did not have reinforcement available and 8 visits to patch B while it did have reinforcement available.
- One group of rats (A=B) received 3 food pellets for each successful foraging trip, while the other group (A>B) received 8 food pellets for a successful trip to patch A and only 1 food pellet for a successful trip to Patch B.
- The rats were further subdivided into groups based on delay to the test trial. The delays were 1, 240, 360, and 1440 minutes. 
- The test trial did not include the divider and the rats were allowed to choose between the two patches. Neither patch had reinforcement available.
